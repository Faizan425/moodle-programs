problem
Given a number with maximum of 100 digits as input, find the difference between the sum

of odd and even position digits.

Input Format:

Take a number in the form of String from stdin.

Output Format:

Print the difference between sum of even and odd digits

Example input:

1453

Output:

1

Explanation:

Here, sum of even digits is 4 + 3 = 7

sum of odd digits is 1 + 5 = 6.

Difference is 1.

Note that we are always taking absolute difference

code
def differenceSum(n):
    s=str(n)
    odd_sum=0
    even_sum=0
    for x in range(0,len(s),2):
        odd_sum+=int(s[x])
    for y in range(1,len(s),2):
        even_sum+=int(s[y])
    diff=abs(odd_sum-even_sum)
    return diff
