Problem Statement:
Write a python program that takes a integer between 0 and 15 as input and displays the number of '1' s in its binary form.(Hint:use python bitwise operator.

Sample Input

3

Sample Output:

2

Explanation:

The binary representation of 3 is 011, hence there are 2 ones in it. so the output is 2.


Code:
x=int(input())
x=str(bin(x))
count=0
for i in x:
    if(i=='1'):
        count+=1
print(count)
