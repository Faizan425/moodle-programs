Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number. Solve the problem using set.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3



Code:
L=input().split(" ")
d={}
for x in L:
    if(x in d):
        d[x]+=1
    else:
        d[x]=1
for s,count in d.items():
    if(count>1):
        print(s)
