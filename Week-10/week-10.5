problem
Given an listof integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.

3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.

For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort: a=[6,4,1]. It took  3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6   
Input Format

The first line contains an integer,n , the size of the list a .
The second line contains  n,  space-separated integers a[i].

Constraints

·         2<=n<=600

·         1<=a[i]<=2x106.

Output Format

You must print the following three lines of output:

1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.

3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.

Sample Input 0

3

1 2 3

Sample Output 0

List is sorted in 0 swaps.

First Element: 1

Last Element: 3
code
n=int(input())
L=input().split(" ")
L=[int(x) for x in L if x!='']
swaps=0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(n-i-1):
        if(L[j]>L[j+1]):
            t=L[j]
            L[j]=L[j+1]
            L[j+1]=t
            swaps+=1
print(f'List is sorted in {swaps} swaps.')
print(f'First Element: {L[0]}')
print(f'Last Element: {L[n-1]}')
