problem
Given an list, find peak element in it. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

An element a[i] is a peak element if

A[i-1] <= A[i] >=a[i+1] for middle elements. [0<i<n-1]

A[i-1] <= A[i] for last element [i=n-1]

A[i]>=A[i+1] for first element [i=0]

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n , the length of A .
The second line contains n space-separated integers,A[i].

Output Format

Print peak numbers separated by space.

Sample Input

5

8 9 10 2 6

Sample Output

10 6

        peak.append(L[x])
    elif(x==n-1 and(L[x]>L[x-1])):
        peak.append(L[x])
    elif(L[x]>L[x-1] and L[x]>L[x+1]):
        peak.append(L[x])
